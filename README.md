# Portfolio Reflection

    When we were asked to create a portfolio website design in our User Experience Design Class I thought about how I wanted to layout my design and felt that I didn't want anything too out there or flashy, just a simple design that conveyed my art style and general feeling of my work.

## How I Accomplished This

---

    By using some of my own artwork and a a bright colour scheme of yellow and blue to match my personal logo I was able to make a website that I feel brings out my personality and art style. My logo is inspired by traditional sign painting and was created with the font "Upright Casual" from [Kern Club](https://kernclub.com) which I feel lends itself well as that is an art and design style that inspires me. Carrying this logo's colour scheme throughout the website I was able to make my buttons and navigation items reflect these colours giving the website a unified feel. I am interested in a more "low-brow" art style which is reflected in my work so I chose to feature a number of those pieces in my gallery first to show where my strengths and interests lie while featuring a number of more diverse works from past classes in my Interactive Media Design Program to show more versatility.

## Challenges in Creating this Website

---

    One of the major setbacks of my website creation and something that had to be changed between my original design and the final product was actually my font choice on my headings. Because the "Upright Casual" font is not a web font I was not able to transition it over. I needed to find another font that I felt was playful enough but still easy to read. I decided on the Poppins font for my headings as the blocky style made it to be less serious and business like but still easily readable. Another problem that I encountered was how I was going to set up my gallery to give it a uniform look despite not all of the images being the same shape. I was able to overcome this by placing the taller images together in the middle row and altering the middle image to conform to surrounding sizes. This allowed me to keep a nice balance of smaller images on the top and bottom while highlighting the middle section.
