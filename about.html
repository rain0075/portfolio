        Who am I?
    </h1>

    <p>
        For as long as I can remember I have always been interested in art and design. Since I was a kid I always looked at packaging and advertisements and and wanted to learn how to design them.

        Since then I have taken art all through school and really felt that was what I wanted to do with my life. Besides taking art and design classes in high school I have searched out artists and designers who inspired me and have taken much inspiration for low brow and street artists as well as traditional sign painters and tattoo artists.

        I have since built my style of art and design around some of the more non-traditional styles of seen in this modern age of clean lines and boring font. If you are interested in logos designs or drawings that are off the beaten path or appeal to the weirder side of yourself look no further!

        I have done work for music artists creating album cover designs as well as advertisements for mobile game, video interviews promoting web comics and several logo designs!

        If you want to see some of my work you can check out my <a href="gallery.html"> Gallery</a> page and if you have any questions or inquires shoot me a line on the <a href="contact.html"> Contact</a> section!

        Thanks for stopping by!
